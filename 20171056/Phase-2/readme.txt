My index contains 164 index files 
1 file for tokens and their respective line seek numbers (tokens.txt)
1 file for names of titles. (titles.txt)

Naming convention for catgories:

    index_block_<block_no>_<category>.txt

Each category has 27 blocks (26 [a-z], 1 [0-9])blocks

Therefore 6 * 27 + 2 = 164 files
